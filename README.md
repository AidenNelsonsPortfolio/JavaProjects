# JavaProjects
Here are most of my most important/difficult Java projects that I have built so far, mostly during schooling.

Most of my most noteworthy projects are in their own repo's, though, so look out for them there, with much better documentation and explanations of their purpose.

I hope that you enjoy and find something interesting!
